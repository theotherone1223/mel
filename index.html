  <h2 class="topics">games</h2>
  <p>I enjoy playing games to either build things,fight or argue.When i build i enjoy being able to seee what i'm building.I get on peoples nerves on purpose a lot just for the thrill.Arguing with people so much while playing games gave me more confidence in real life.Building in games simplifies life a bit because of how much i can acheive in a controlled environement.</p>
  <h2 class="topics">puzzles</h2>
  <p>I enjoy figuring things out and putting things together.Having the control over the puzzle peices and being able to manipulate the peices and put it together brings me joy.I also enjoy riddles and suddoku.These are just things that makes my life feel more simple.Playing these games help me think.</p>
  <h2 class="topics">music</h2>
  <p>I enjoy listening to music because it makes me feel complete I also enjoy playing music for people.One of my favorite artists is melanie martinez because she almost always has a meaning behind her songs.She also makes it very clear that she is a human being and not just a machine built to satisfy her fans wants.Without melanie martinez i don't thing I would be able to express myself as much.She brings out a lot of strong emotions out of me. </p>
